# README

rant! is my final project for learn.co. it is made with angular+rails. It is inspired by http://www.themostdangerouswritingapp.com/. The basic concept is that a user must continuosly type input or else the input will be irretrievably lost. The "writing" section of the app uses jQuery and the rest of the app uses Angular for the views and Rails for the backend. The app also includes some very basic sentiment analysis functionality via the sentimental gem (https://github.com/7compass/sentimental). 

To install this app locally, simply clone the repo and run '''bundle install''' and '''rails db:migrate'''.
